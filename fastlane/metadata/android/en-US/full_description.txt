VPT#018-VPC is an android app that swiftly calculates the mass of alcohol (in grams) contained in a given volume of a beverage (in milliliters) when alcohol content (Vol.-% or v/v) is known.

It uses the formula: mass (g) = volume (mL) * Vol-%/100 * specific weight of alcohol (0.793 g/mL)

<b>Features:<b>

* 🖩 <strong>Calculate mass, or volume, or content (v/v)</strong> of an alcoholic beverage by entering the 2 other data points.
* 🎨 <strong>Intuitive Interface</strong> - Clear buttons and layout, simple to understand.
* 🔄 <strong>Dynamic Field Adjustments</strong> - Modify any data field post-calculation, and the app will update the other relevant fields (right now function via pressing "Calculate" again after modifying fields).
* 🚨 <strong>Plausibility Warnings</strong> - The screen will flash red if any of the values are totally out of place, such as above 100% alcohol content or volumes above 10 liters, informing the user that something probably went wrong. Calculation still finishes.
* <strong>Localization</strong> - Right now: English, German

<b>Usage:<b>

1. Enter your data in any 2 of the 3 fields
2. Tap "Calculate"
3. View your results
4. To clear all 3 fields, tap the "clear" Button.
