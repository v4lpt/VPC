# VPT-018 - Volume Percent Calculator 
VPT#018-VPC is an android app that easily calculates the mass of alcohol (in grams) contained in a given volume of an alcoholic solution (in milliliters) when alcohol content (Vol.-% or v/v) is known.

It uses the formula: 
\[
\text{mass [g]} = \frac{\text{volume [mL]} \cdot (\text{Vol.-\% [\%]} / 100)}{\text{specific weight of alcohol 0.789 [g/mL]}}
\]

- ðŸ–©  **Calculate Volume, Content, Mass**  of the alcohol by entering the 2 other fields.

- ðŸŽ¨ **User-Friendly Design** - Clear buttons and layout, simple to understand.

- ðŸ”„ **Dynamic Field Adjustments** - Modify any data field post-calculation, and the app will update the other relevant fields (right now function via pressing "Calculate" again after modifying fields).

- ðŸš¨ **Plausibility Warnings** - The screen will flash red if any of the values are totally out of place, such as above 100% alcohol content or volumes above 10 liters, informing the user that something probably went wrong. Calculation still finishes. 

- **Localization** - Right now: English, German 

## Usage
- Enter your data in any 2 of the 3 fields
- Tap "Calculate" 
- View your results 

- to clear all 3 fields tap the "clear" Button.
